Accessibility is a legal requirement\ldots{} I am not a lawyer. Seek advice.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Equal access:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    England, Scotland, Wales: \href{https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents}{Equality Act 2010}

  Accessible web content (considered to cover University VLE content):

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{but-we-should-care-anyway}{%
\subsection{But we should care anyway\ldots{}}\label{but-we-should-care-anyway}}

Mathematics at university level is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``characterised by the need for a high degree of conceptual and abstract thinking within the learning process'' (Mathematics Subject Benchmark)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{We want} students to have the processing capacity to engage with concepts and abstract thinking!

Students with a print disability, with difficulties with taking notes, memory and concentration may spend substantial processing capacity on entirely different tasks.

\hypertarget{what-are-the-problems}{%
\section{What are the problems?}\label{what-are-the-problems}}

Generally speaking we need to make it possible to access and consume information in a variety of ways.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All students, but especially those with e.g.~Dyslexia, benefit from colourful, interactive, responsive resources with well rendered maths and graphics, enriched with video and audio. Go for it!
\item
  But poorly made resources create practical and technical barriers:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Complex navigation/accurate input hard using keyboard/pointer only
  \item
    Maths needs to be chunkable and navigable for speech, magnification, Braille and small screens
  \item
    Use of colour-only to give meaning is a problem
  \item
    Raster graphics do not magnify/zoom well
  \item
    Responsive pages with multiple foci hard for VI users
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{maths-in-pdf-is-inaccessible}{%
\subsection{Maths in PDF is inaccessible}\label{maths-in-pdf-is-inaccessible}}

\hypertarget{could-we-solve-it-by}{%
\subsection{Could we solve it by\ldots?}\label{could-we-solve-it-by}}

You might ask, can we not solve this by ensuring that the PDF is accessible? Unfortunately, the answer is no. The act of creating the PDF destroys information about the structure of the mathematical expression.

\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth,height=\textheight]{./Figs/reflowing.png}

\hypertarget{what-are-the-solutions}{%
\section{What are the solutions?}\label{what-are-the-solutions}}

Using assistive technology effectively for maths requires:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Authors to produce accessible mathematical materials
\item
  Readers to have assistive technology which works with the specific format of mathematical text
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

Computers rely on structural integrity to process maths:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  PDF, print, handwriting and E-books using images of maths cannot be processed. They are inaccessible and inflexible on, for instance, small screen devices. They are lossy formats for maths!
\item
  Word, HTML based formats and EPub3 have structural integrity for maths and are accessible to many assistive technologies
\item
  But not all AT can access maths all formats! PowerPoint 365 is theoretically accessible but most AT won't work with it
\item
  And most mathematicians use specialist scientific document preparation systems such as LaTeX, which, historically, have not output these formats
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{could-we-convert-the-latex}{%
\subsection{Could we convert the LaTeX?}\label{could-we-convert-the-latex}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It depends on the LaTeX\ldots{}
\item
  It is \textbf{not possible} to convert LaTeX to html in the general case
\item
  It is easy to `fall out' of the convertible subset without realising or knowing why, the addition of a package, change of preamble order, use of a seemingly innocent command\ldots{}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{could-we-convert-the-mathematicians}{%
\subsection{Could we convert the mathematicians?!}\label{could-we-convert-the-mathematicians}}

Any new document preparation system needs to \textbf{\emph{enable}} the writer by providing the key features of mathematical/scientific document preparation. And these features make things complex.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Software is catching up and in flux.
\item
  Nothing is easy to learn.
\end{itemize}

Increasingly mathematicians are exploring and converting, but they need appropriate institutional infrastructure, support, workload time allocation and training. Without this the task remains unreasonable.

\hypertarget{what-do-we-convert-to}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What do we convert \textbf{\emph{to}}?}{What do we convert to?}}\label{what-do-we-convert-to}}

Only three formats of mathematical text are accessible:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  HTML using MathJax to render the mathematics
\item
  Word/PowerPoint using the inbuilt equation editor
\item
  EPub3 using MathML
\end{itemize}

Whatever \textbf{other} formats you supply you \textbf{must} supply at least one or, ideally, all of these to meet the public bodies requirement.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Supply your course content `spine' in this format.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{is-that-enough}{%
\subsection{Is that enough?}\label{is-that-enough}}

No.~The equal access acts mean we need to meet individual needs so you may need to produce any of the other formats. This makes PowerPoint a problem as it cannot be converted.

\textbf{And} you also need to supply PDF!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Not all accessibility is about technical access
\item
  Clear print PDF is selected most often by disabled students in the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-do-you-get-started}{%
\section{How do you get started?}\label{how-do-you-get-started}}

Ideals are great but let us be pragmatic.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assess where you are
\item
  Have a plan for meeting individual needs for equal access

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Leadership: Recognise this may be expensive for a number of years. It will get cheaper. We've been doing this for nearly 20 years. This semester one lecturer used this plan.\\
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Pick something achieveable to change in your general practice

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Leadership: What is achievable depends on the resources you provide and this is what ultimately reduces risk and cost.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Start!

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Be clear about what is and is not accessible and what a student should do if they need a different format (see having a plan)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{wordpowerpoint-365}{%
\subsection{Word/PowerPoint 365}\label{wordpowerpoint-365}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Use the inbuilt Accessibility Checker and information on e.g.~\href{https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/make-your-word-documents-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-d9bf3683-87ac-47ea-b91a-78dcacb3c66d}{Making your Word documents accessible}
\item
  Write \emph{all} mathematical text written using the MS 365 equation editor. E.g. if you are writing about the variable \(x\) or \(\theta\) it should be written as an equation. If you are writing \(x^2\) it should be written as an equation.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Never use insert symbol.
  \item
    Never write superscripts, subscripts, fractions etc. using font or style changes and standard keyboard input alone
  \item
    Never use an image of an equation.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Use Review -\textgreater{} Read Aloud (Alt + Ctrl + Space) to check the maths
\end{itemize}

More information and tools within \href{https://stem-enable.github.io/WordWorkshop/}{accessible mathematical Word document workshop resources} and \href{https://bathmash.github.io/gettingstarted/Word/index.html}{effective (keyboard-only) input of maths in Word}.

\hypertarget{sounds-solved-to-me}{%
\subsection{Sounds solved to me?}\label{sounds-solved-to-me}}

Some students will require MathType format

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Because their AT vendor has not implemented the interface to Word but the AT does work with MathType. Test everything and contact the vendors!
\item
  Materials should be prepared as above and then a \textbf{\emph{copy}} converted to MathType as automatic conversion of all expressions cannot be reversed.
\end{itemize}

Also\ldots{} this generally won't work for the mathematicians and some scientists.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Word is not a scientific document preparation system.
\item
  For those who use LaTeX we need a different plan.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{web-wcag-2.1-aa-mathjax}{%
\subsection{Web: WCAG 2.1 AA + MathJax!}\label{web-wcag-2.1-aa-mathjax}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Check it meets the legal requirement of WCAG 2.1 Level AA with e.g.~\href{https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/overview}{Accessibility Insights for Web plugin for Chrome}
\item
  Check it is MathJax\ldots{} Right click!
  \[x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Provides/enables: navigation, chunking, zoom, copy/paste, colour, size and layout changes\ldots{}
  \item
    Structural integrity enables assistive technology including text-to-speech, screenreaders, electronic Braille
  \item
    Fallback for ARIA-aware AT without native support
  \item
    AT providers without native support and not ARIA aware are a problem but not your problem.

\hypertarget{supporting-mathematicians}{%
\subsection{Supporting mathematicians}\label{supporting-mathematicians}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Web + MathJax is the most accessible end format for a mathematical or scientific document but we need a way to prepare the document.
\item
  We are not perscriptive, we'll support anything which works.
\item
  Two main approaches have attracted most of the mathematicians at Bath but there are some other rarer contenders!
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{try-converting-the-latex}{%
\subsection{Try converting the LaTeX}\label{try-converting-the-latex}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Experts: \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/bathmash/mathaltnotes}{tools which may work for a large subset but cannot tell you anything about why something doesn't work}
\item
  Non-experts at Bath who want to stick with LaTeX have found that \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/lwarp?lang=en}{lwarp} works for them if they are careful.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Beware of some hard work (documentation currently 1237 pages)
  \item
    What happens depends on what you are doing in LaTeX
  \item
    You have to work that out and test for accessibility for yourself.

RMarkdown is a language designed for transform to html

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  Simple markup language for the rest of the document.
\item
  Authors are confined to a transformable subset with a quick compile loop and a supportive GUI.
\item
  The output has known accessibility features.
\item
  The typesetting is still extensible, just more reasonably so.

Students with a print disability, with difficulties with taking notes, memory and concentration may spend substantial processing capacity on entirely different tasks. "],["what-are-the-problems.html", "2 What are the problems?", " 2 What are the problems? Generally speaking we need to make it possible to access and consume information in a variety of ways. All students, but especially those with e.g. Dyslexia, benefit from colourful, interactive, responsive resources with well rendered maths and graphics, enriched with video and audio. Go for it! But poorly made resources create practical and technical barriers: Complex navigation/accurate input hard using keyboard/pointer only Maths needs to be chunkable and navigable for speech, magnification, Braille and small screens Use of colour-only to give meaning is a problem Raster graphics do not magnify/zoom well Responsive pages with multiple foci hard for VI users "],["maths-in-pdf-is-inaccessible.html", "2.1 Maths in PDF is inaccessible", " 2.1 Maths in PDF is inaccessible "],["could-we-solve-it-by.html", "2.2 Could we solve it by…?", " 2.2 Could we solve it by…?

Using assistive technology effectively for maths requires: Authors to produce accessible mathematical materials Readers to have assistive technology which works with the specific format of mathematical text "],["structure.html", "3.1 Structure", " 3.1 Structure Computers rely on structural integrity to process maths: PDF, print, handwriting and E-books using images of maths cannot be processed. They are inaccessible and inflexible on, for instance, small screen devices. They are lossy formats for maths! Word, HTML based formats and EPub3 have structural integrity for maths and are accessible to many assistive technologies But not all AT can access maths all formats! PowerPoint 365 is theoretically accessible but most AT won’t work with it And most mathematicians use specialist scientific document preparation systems such as LaTeX, which, historically, have not output these formats "],["could-we-convert-the-latex.html", "3.2 Could we convert the LaTeX?", " 3.2 Could we convert the LaTeX?

Any new document preparation system needs to enable the writer by providing the key features of mathematical/scientific document preparation. And these features make things complex. Software is catching up and in flux. Nothing is easy to learn.

Without this the task remains unreasonable. "],["what-do-we-convert-to.html", "3.4 What do we convert to?", " 3.4 What do we convert to?

We’ve been doing this for nearly 20 years. This semester one lecturer used this plan. Pick something achieveable to change in your general practice Leadership: What is achievable depends on the resources you provide and this is what ultimately reduces risk and cost. Start!
